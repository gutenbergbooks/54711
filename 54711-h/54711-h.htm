<h2><span class="smcap">Sweet and Twenty</span></h2>


<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Scene</span>&mdash;<i>A corner of the cherry orchard on the country
place of the late Mr. Boggley, now on sale and
open for inspection to prospective buyers. The
cherry orchard, now in full bloom, is a very
pleasant place. There is a green-painted rustic
bench beside the path....</i></p>

<p class="hanging">(<i>This scene can be effectively produced on a small
stage by a back-drop painted a blue-green color, with
a single conventionalized cherry branch painted
across it, and two three-leaved screens masking the
wings, painted in blue-green with a spray of cherry
blossoms</i>).</p>

<p class="hanging"><i>A young woman, dressed in a light summer frock
and carrying a parasol, drifts in from the back.
She sees the bench, comes over to it and sits down
with an air of petulant weariness.</i></p>

<p class="hanging"><i>A handsome young man enters from the right. He
stops short in surprise on seeing the charming
stranger who lolls upon the bench. He takes off
his hat.</i></p>

<p class="charac">HE</p>

<p>Oh, I beg your pardon!</p>

<p class="charac">SHE</p>

<p>Oh, you needn't! I've no right to be here,
either.</p>

<p class="charac">HE</p>

<p>(<i>Coming down to her</i>) Now what do you mean
by that?</p>

<p class="charac">SHE</p>

<p>I thought perhaps you were playing truant,
as I am.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p class="charac">HE</p>

<p>Playing truant?</p>

<p class="charac">SHE</p>

<p>I was looking at the house, you know. And I
got tired and ran away.</p>

<p class="charac">HE</p>

<p>Well, to tell the truth, so did I. It's dull work,
isn't it?</p>

<p class="charac">SHE</p>

<p>I've been upstairs and down for two hours.
That family portrait gallery finished me. It
was so old and gloomy and dead that I felt as
if I were dead myself. I just had to do something.
I wanted to jab my parasol through the
window-pane. I understood just how the suffragettes
felt. But I was afraid of shocking
the agent. He is such a meek little man, and
he seemed to think so well of me. If I had
broken the window I would have shattered his
ideals of womanhood, too, I'm afraid. So I
just slipped away quietly and came here.</p>

<p class="charac">HE</p>

<p>I've only been there half an hour and we&mdash;I've
only been in the basement. That's why
our tours of inspection didn't bring us together
sooner. I've been cross-examining the furnace.
Do you understand furnaces? (<i>He sits down
beside her</i>) I don't.</p>

<p class="charac">SHE</p>

<p>Do you like family portraits? I hate 'em!</p>

<p class="charac">HE</p>

<p>What! Do the family portraits go with the
house?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p class="charac">SHE</p>

<p>No, thank heaven. They've been bequeathed
to the Metropolitan Museum of Horrors, I understand.
They're valuable historically&mdash;early
colonial governors and all that sort of stuff.
But there is someone with me who&mdash;who takes
a deep interest in such things.</p>

<p class="charac">HE</p>

<p>(<i>frowning at a sudden memory</i>) Hm. Didn't
I see you at that real estate office in New York
yesterday?</p>

<p class="charac">SHE</p>

<p>Yes. <i>He</i> was with me then.</p>

<p class="charac">HE <span class="stagedir">(<i>compassionately</i>)</span></p>

<p>I&mdash;I thought I remembered seeing you with&mdash;with
him.</p>

<p class="charac">SHE <span class="stagedir">(<i>cheerfully</i>)</span></p>

<p>Isn't he <i>just</i> the sort of man who would be interested
in family portraits?</p>

<p class="charac">HE <span class="stagedir">(<i>confused</i>)</span></p>

<p>Well&mdash;since you ask me&mdash;I&mdash;!</p>

<p class="charac">SHE</p>

<p>Oh, that's all right. Tubby's a dear, in spite
of his funny old ideas. I like him very much.</p>

<p class="charac">HE</p>

<p>(<i>gulping the pill</i>) Yes....</p>

<p class="charac">SHE</p>

<p>He's so anxious to please me in buying this
house. I suppose it's all right to have a house,
but I'd like to become acquainted with it gradually.
I'd like to feel that there was always
some corner left to explore&mdash;some mystery<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
saved up for a rainy day. Tubby can't understand
that. He drags me everywhere, explaining
how we'll keep this and change that&mdash;dormer
windows here and perhaps a new wing
there.... I suppose you've been rebuilding
the house, too?</p>

<p class="charac">HE</p>

<p>No. Merely decided to turn that sunny south
room into a study. It would make a very
pleasant place to work. But if you really want
the place, I'd hate to take it away from you.</p>

<p class="charac">SHE</p>

<p>I was just going to say that if <i>you</i> really wanted
it, <i>I'd</i> withdraw. It was Tubby's idea to buy
it, you know&mdash;not mine. You <i>do</i> want it, don't
you?</p>

<p class="charac">HE</p>

<p>I can't say that I do. It's so infernally big.
But Maria thinks I ought to have it. (<i>Explanatorily</i>)
Maria is&mdash;</p>

<p class="charac">SHE <span class="stagedir">(<i>gently</i>)</span></p>

<p>She's&mdash;the one who <i>is</i> interested in furnaces,
I understand. I saw her with you at the real-estate
office yesterday. Well&mdash;furnaces are
necessary, I suppose. (<i>There is a pause, which
she breaks suddenly</i>) Do you see that bee?</p>

<p class="charac">HE</p>

<p>A bee? (<i>He follows her gaze up to a cluster of
blossoms.</i>)</p>

<p class="charac">SHE</p>

<p>Yes&mdash;there! (<i>Affectionately</i>) The rascal! There
he goes. (<i>Their eyes follow the flight of the bee
across the orchard. There is a silence, in which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
Maria and Tubby drift into the limbo of forgotten
things. Alone together beneath the blossoms, a
spell seems to have fallen upon them. She tries to
think of something to say&mdash;and at last succeeds.</i>)</p>

<p class="charac">SHE</p>

<p>Have you heard the story of the people who
used to live here?</p>

<p class="charac">HE</p>

<p>No; why?</p>

<p class="charac">SHE</p>

<p>An agent was telling us. It's quite romantic&mdash;and
rather sad. You see, the man that built
this house was in love with a girl. He was
building it for her&mdash;as a surprise. But he had
neglected to mention to her that he was in love
with her. And so, in pique, she married another
man, though she was really in love with
him. The news came just when he had finished
the house. He shut it up for a year or two, but
eventually married someone else, and they lived
here for ten years&mdash;most unhappily. Then
they went abroad, and the house was sold. It
was bought, curiously enough, by the husband
of the girl he had been in love with. They lived
here till they died&mdash;hating each other to the
end, the agent says.</p>

<p class="charac">HE</p>

<p>It gives me the shivers. To think of that house,
haunted by the memories of wasted love!
Which of us, I wonder, will have to live in it?
I don't want to.</p>

<p class="charac">SHE <span class="stagedir">(<i>prosaically</i>)</span></p>

<p>Oh, don't take it so seriously as all that. If<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
one can't live in a house where there's been an
unhappy marriage, why, good heavens, where
<i>is</i> one going to live? Most marriages, I fancy,
are unhappy.</p>

<p class="charac">HE</p>

<p>A bitter philosophy for one so&mdash;</p>

<p class="charac">SHE</p>

<p>Nonsense! But listen to the rest of the story.
The most interesting part is about this very
orchard.</p>

<p class="charac">HE</p>

<p>Really!</p>

<p class="charac">SHE</p>

<p>Yes. This orchard, it seems, was here before
the house was. It was part of an old farm
where he and she&mdash;the unhappy lovers, you
know&mdash;stopped one day, while they were out
driving, and asked for something to eat. The
farmer's wife was busy, but she gave them
each a glass of milk, and told them they could
eat all the cherries they wanted. So they
picked a hatful of cherries, and ate them, sitting
on a bench like this one. And then he fell
in love with her....</p>

<p class="charac">HE</p>

<p>And ... didn't tell her so.... (<i>She
glances at him in alarm. His self-possession has
vanished. He is pale and frightened, but there is
a desperate look in his eyes, as if some unknown
power were forcing him to do something very rash.
In short, he seems like a young man who has just
fallen in love.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p class="charac">SHE <span class="stagedir">(<i>hastily</i>)</span></p>

<p>So you see this orchard is haunted, too!</p>

<p class="charac">HE</p>

<p>I feel it. I seem to hear the ghost of that old-time
lover whispering to me....</p>

<p class="charac">SHE <span class="stagedir">(<i>provocatively</i>)</span></p>

<p>Indeed! What does he say?</p>

<p class="charac">HE</p>

<p>He says: "I was a coward; you must be bold.
I was silent; you must speak out."</p>

<p class="charac">SHE <span class="stagedir">(<i>mischievously</i>)</span></p>

<p>That's very curious&mdash;because that old lover
isn't dead at all. He's a baronet or something
in England.</p>

<p class="charac">HE <span class="stagedir">(<i>earnestly</i>)</span></p>

<p>His youth is dead; and it is his youth that
speaks to me.</p>

<p class="charac">SHE <span class="stagedir">(<i>quickly</i>)</span></p>

<p>You mustn't believe all that ghosts tell you.</p>

<p class="charac">HE</p>

<p>Oh, but I must. For they know the folly of
silence&mdash;the bitterness of cowardice.</p>

<p class="charac">SHE</p>

<p>The circumstances were&mdash;slightly&mdash;different,
weren't they?</p>

<p class="charac">HE <span class="stagedir">(<i>stubbornly</i>)</span></p>

<p>I don't care!</p>

<p class="charac">SHE <span class="stagedir">(<i>soberly</i>)</span></p>

<p>You know perfectly well it's no use.</p>

<p class="charac">HE</p>

<p>I can't help that!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p class="charac">SHE</p>

<p>Please! You simply mustn't! It's disgraceful!</p>

<p class="charac">HE</p>

<p>What's disgraceful?</p>

<p class="charac">SHE <span class="stagedir">(<i>confused</i>)</span></p>

<p>What you are going to say.</p>

<p class="charac">HE <span class="stagedir">(<i>simply</i>)</span></p>

<p>Only that I love you. What is there disgraceful
about that? It's beautiful!</p>

<p class="charac">SHE</p>

<p>It's wrong.</p>

<p class="charac">HE</p>

<p>It's inevitable.</p>

<p class="charac">SHE</p>

<p>Why inevitable? Can't you talk with a girl in
a cherry orchard for half an hour without falling
in love with her?</p>

<p class="charac">HE</p>

<p>Not if the girl is you.</p>

<p class="charac">SHE</p>

<p>But why especially <i>me</i>?</p>

<p class="charac">HE</p>

<p>I don't know. Love&mdash;is a mystery. I only
know that I was destined to love you.</p>

<p class="charac">SHE</p>

<p>How can you be so sure?</p>

<p class="charac">HE</p>

<p>Because you have changed the world for me.
It's as though I had been groping about in the
dark, and then&mdash;sunrise! And there's a queer
feeling here. (<i>He puts his hand on his heart</i>)
To tell the honest truth, there's a still queerer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
feeling in the pit of my stomach. It's a gone
feeling, if you must know. And my knees are
weak. I know now why men used to fall on
their knees when they told a girl they loved
her; it was because they couldn't stand up.
And there's a feeling in my feet as though I
were walking on air. And&mdash;</p>

<p class="charac">SHE <span class="stagedir">(<i>faintly</i>)</span></p>

<p>That's enough!</p>

<p class="charac">HE</p>

<p>And I could die for you and be glad of the
chance. It's perfectly absurd, but it's absolutely
true. I've never spoken to you before,
and heaven knows I may never get a chance to
speak to you again, but I'd never forgive myself
if I didn't say this to you now. I love
you! love you! love you! Now tell me I'm a
fool. Tell me to go. Anything&mdash;I've said my
say.... Why don't you speak?</p>

<p class="charac">SHE</p>

<p>I&mdash;I've nothing to say&mdash;except&mdash;except that I&mdash;well&mdash;(<i>almost
inaudibly</i>) I feel some of those
symptoms myself.</p>

<p class="charac">HE <span class="stagedir">(<i>triumphantly</i>)</span></p>

<p>You love me!</p>

<p class="charac">SHE</p>

<p>I&mdash;don't know. Yes. Perhaps.</p>

<p class="charac">HE</p>

<p>Then kiss me!</p>

<p class="charac">SHE <span class="stagedir">(<i>doubtfully</i>)</span></p>

<p>No....</p>

<p class="charac">HE</p>

<p>Kiss me!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p class="charac">SHE <span class="stagedir">(<i>tormentedly</i>)</span></p>

<p>Oh, what's the use?</p>

<p class="charac">HE</p>

<p>I don't know. I don't care. I only know that
we love each other.</p>

<p class="charac">SHE</p>

<p>(<i>after a moment's hesitation, desperately</i>) I don't
care, either! I <i>do</i> want to kiss you. (<i>She does....
He is the first to awake from the ecstasy.</i>)</p>

<p class="charac">HE</p>

<p>It is wicked&mdash;</p>

<p class="charac">SHE <span class="stagedir">(<i>absently</i>)</span></p>

<p>Is it?</p>

<p class="charac">HE</p>

<p>But, oh heaven! kiss me again! (<i>She does.</i>)</p>

<p class="charac">SHE</p>

<p>Darling!</p>

<p class="charac">HE</p>

<p>Do you suppose anyone is likely to come this
way?</p>

<p class="charac">SHE</p>

<p>No.</p>

<p class="charac">HE <span class="stagedir">(<i>speculatively</i>)</span></p>

<p>Your husband is probably still
in the portrait gallery....</p>

<p class="charac">SHE</p>

<p>My husband! (<i>Drawing away</i>) What do you
mean? (<i>Thoroughly awake now</i>) You didn't
think&mdash;? (<i>She jumps up and laughs convulsively</i>)
He thought poor old Tubby was my
husband!!</p>

<p class="charac">HE</p>

<p>(<i>staring up at her bewildered</i>) Why, isn't he
your husband?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p class="charac">SHE <span class="stagedir">(<i>scornfully</i>)</span></p>

<p>No!! He's my uncle!</p>

<p class="charac">HE</p>

<p>Your unc&mdash;</p>

<p class="charac">SHE</p>

<p>Yes, of course! (<i>Indignantly</i>) Do you suppose
I would be married to a man that's fat and bald
and forty years old?</p>

<p class="charac">HE <span class="stagedir">(<i>distressed</i>)</span></p>

<p>I&mdash;I beg your pardon. I did think so.</p>

<p class="charac">SHE</p>

<p>Just because you saw me with him? How
ridiculous!</p>

<p class="charac">HE</p>

<p>It was a silly mistake. But&mdash;the things you said!
You spoke so&mdash;realistically&mdash;about marriage.</p>

<p class="charac">SHE</p>

<p>It was <i>your</i> marriage I was speaking about.
(<i>With hasty compunction</i>) Oh, I beg your&mdash;</p>

<p class="charac">HE</p>

<p><i>My</i> marriage! (<i>He rises</i>) Good heavens! And
to whom, pray, did you think I was married?
(<i>A light dawning</i>) To Maria? Why, Maria is
my aunt!</p>

<p class="charac">SHE</p>

<p>Yes&mdash;of course. How stupid of me.</p>

<p class="charac">HE</p>

<p>Let's get this straight. Are you married to
<i>anybody</i>?</p>

<p class="charac">SHE</p>

<p>Certainly not. As if I would let anybody make
love to me if I were!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p class="charac">HE</p>

<p>Now don't put on airs. You did something
quite as improper. You kissed a married man.</p>

<p class="charac">SHE</p>

<p>I didn't.</p>

<p class="charac">HE</p>

<p>It's the same thing. You <i>thought</i> I was married.</p>

<p class="charac">SHE</p>

<p>But you <i>aren't</i>.</p>

<p class="charac">HE</p>

<p>No. I'm <i>not</i> married. And&mdash;and&mdash;<i>you're</i> not
married. (<i>The logic of the situation striking him
all of a sudden</i>) In fact&mdash;! (<i>He pauses, rather
alarmed.</i>)</p>

<p class="charac">SHE</p>

<p>Yes?</p>

<p class="charac">HE</p>

<p>In fact&mdash;well&mdash;there's no reason in the world
why we <i>shouldn't</i> make love to each other!</p>

<p class="charac">SHE</p>

<p>(<i>equally startled</i>) Why&mdash;that's so!</p>

<p class="charac">HE</p>

<p>Then&mdash;then&mdash;shall we?</p>

<p class="charac">SHE</p>

<p>(<i>sitting down and looking demurely at her toes</i>)
Oh, not if you don't want to!</p>

<p class="charac">HE</p>

<p>(<i>adjusting himself to the situation</i>) Well&mdash;under
the circumstances&mdash;I suppose I ought to begin
by asking you to marry me....</p>

<p class="charac">SHE</p>

<p>(<i>languidly, with a provoking glance</i>) You don't
seem very anxious to.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p class="charac">HE</p>

<p>(<i>feeling at a disadvantage</i>) It isn't that&mdash;but&mdash;well&mdash;</p>

<p class="charac">SHE <span class="stagedir">(<i>lightly</i>)</span></p>

<p>Well what?</p>

<p class="charac">HE</p>

<p>Dash it all, I don't know your name!</p>

<p class="charac">SHE</p>

<p>(<i>looking at him with wild curiosity</i>) That didn't
seem to stop you a while ago....</p>

<p class="charac">HE <span class="stagedir">(<i>doggedly</i>)</span></p>

<p>Well, then&mdash;will you marry me?</p>

<p class="charac">SHE <span class="stagedir">(<i>promptly</i>)</span></p>

<p>No.</p>

<p class="charac">HE <span class="stagedir">(<i>surprised</i>)</span></p>

<p>No! Why do you say that?</p>

<p class="charac">SHE <span class="stagedir">(<i>coolly</i>)</span></p>

<p>Why should I marry you? I know nothing
about you. I've known you for less than an
hour.</p>

<p class="charac">HE <span class="stagedir">(<i>sardonically</i>)</span></p>

<p>That fact didn't seem to keep you from kissing
me.</p>

<p class="charac">SHE</p>

<p>Besides&mdash;I don't like the way you go about it.
If you'd propose the same way you made love
to me, maybe I'd accept you.</p>

<p class="charac">HE</p>

<p>All right. (<i>Dropping on one knee before her</i>)
Beloved! (<i>An awkward pause</i>) No, I can't do
it. (<i>He gets up and distractedly dusts off his
knees with his handkerchief</i>) I'm very sorry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p class="charac">SHE</p>

<p>(<i>with calm inquiry</i>) Perhaps it's because you
don't love me any more?</p>

<p class="charac">HE <span class="stagedir">(<i>fretfully</i>)</span></p>

<p>Of course I love you!</p>

<p class="charac">SHE <span class="stagedir">(<i>coldly</i>)</span></p>

<p>But you don't want to marry me.... I
see.</p>

<p class="charac">HE</p>

<p>Not at all! I <i>do</i> want to marry you. But&mdash;</p>

<p class="charac">SHE</p>

<p>Well?</p>

<p class="charac">HE</p>

<p>Marriage is a serious matter. Now don't take
offense! I only meant that&mdash;well&mdash;(<i>He starts
again</i>) We <i>are</i> in love with each other, and
that's the important thing. But, as you said,
we don't know each other. I've no doubt that
when we get acquainted we will like each other
better still. But we've got to get acquainted
first.</p>

<p class="charac">SHE <span class="stagedir">(<i>rising</i>)</span></p>

<p>You're just like Tubby buying a house. You
want to know all about it. Well! I warn you
that you'll never know all about me. So you
needn't try.</p>

<p class="charac">HE <span class="stagedir">(<i>apologetically</i>)</span></p>

<p>It was <i>your</i> suggestion.</p>

<p class="charac">SHE <span class="stagedir">(<i>impatiently</i>)</span></p>

<p>Oh, all right! Go ahead and cross-examine me
if you like. I'll tell you to begin with that I'm
perfectly healthy, and that there's no T. B.,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
insanity, or Socialism in my family. What else
do you want to know?</p>

<p class="charac">HE <span class="stagedir">(<i>hesitantly</i>)</span></p>

<p>Why did you put Socialism in?</p>

<p class="charac">SHE</p>

<p>Oh, just for fun. You aren't a Socialist, are
you?</p>

<p class="charac">HE</p>

<p>Yes. (<i>Earnestly</i>) Do you know what Socialism
is?</p>

<p class="charac">SHE <span class="stagedir">(<i>innocently</i>)</span></p>

<p>It's the same thing as Anarchy, isn't it?</p>

<p class="charac">HE <span class="stagedir">(<i>gently</i>)</span></p>

<p>No. At least not my kind. I believe in municipal
ownership of street cars, and all that
sort of thing. I'll give you some books to read.</p>

<p class="charac">SHE</p>

<p>Well, I never ride in street cars, so I don't care
whether they're municipally owned or not. By
the way, do you dance?</p>

<p class="charac">HE</p>

<p>No.</p>

<p class="charac">SHE</p>

<p>You must learn right away. I can't bother to
teach you myself, but I know where you can
get private lessons and become really good in
a month. It is stupid not to be able to
dance.</p>

<p class="charac">HE</p>

<p>(<i>as if he had tasted quinine</i>) I can see myself
doing the tango! Grr!</p>

<p class="charac">SHE</p>

<p>The tango went out long ago, my dear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p class="charac">HE</p>

<p>(<i>with great decision</i>) Well&mdash;I <i>won't</i> learn to
dance. You might as well know that to begin
with.</p>

<p class="charac">SHE</p>

<p>And I won't read your old books on Socialism.
You might as well know <i>that to begin with</i>!</p>

<p class="charac">HE</p>

<p>Come, come! This will never do. You see,
my dear, it's simply that I <i>can't</i> dance, and
there's no use for me to try to learn.</p>

<p class="charac">SHE</p>

<p>Anybody can learn. I've made expert dancers
out of the awkwardest men!</p>

<p class="charac">HE</p>

<p>But, you see, I've no inclination toward dancing.
It's out of my world.</p>

<p class="charac">SHE</p>

<p>And I've no inclination toward municipal ownership.
<i>It's</i> out of <i>my</i> world!</p>

<p class="charac">HE</p>

<p>It ought not to be out of the world of any intelligent
person.</p>

<p class="charac">SHE</p>

<p>(<i>turning her back on him</i>) All right&mdash;if you want
to call me stupid!</p>

<p class="charac">HE</p>

<p>(<i>turning and looking away meditatively</i>) It appears
that we have very few tastes in common.</p>

<p class="charac">SHE</p>

<p>(<i>tapping her foot</i>) So it seems.</p>

<p class="charac">HE</p>

<p>If we married we might be happy for a month&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p class="charac">SHE</p>

<p>Perhaps. (<i>They remain standing with their backs

<p class="charac">HE</p>

<p>And then&mdash;the old story. Quarrels....</p>

<p class="charac">SHE</p>

Nobody asked you, sir, she said!</p>

<p class="charac">HE</p>

to be no more to say.</p>

<p class="charac">SHE <span class="stagedir">(<i>sweetly</i>)</span></p>

<p>Except good-bye.</p>

<p class="charac">HE <span class="stagedir">(<i>firmly</i>)</span></p>

<p>Good-bye, then. (<i>He holds out his hand.</i>)</p>

Good-bye!</p>

<p class="charac">SHE</p>

<p class="charac">HE</p>

<p>Damn it all, we <i>do</i> love each other!</p>

<p>I wish it were!</p>

go to Europe for a year. Try to forget me.</p>

<p>I shall be married when you get back&mdash;perhaps.</p>

<p class="charac">THE YOUNG MAN</p>

<p>No! Just in time!</p>

<p class="charac">THE AGENT</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p class="charac">THE AGENT</p>

<p>What's the use? It has already begun. What
good can I do now?</p>

<p class="charac">THE YOUNG MAN</p>

<p>I'll show you what good you can do now. Come
here! (<i>The Agent approaches</i>) Can you unloose
my hands from those of this young woman?</p>

<p class="charac">THE YOUNG WOMAN</p>

<p>(<i>haughtily releasing herself and walking away</i>)
You needn't trouble! I can do it myself.</p>

<p class="charac">THE YOUNG MAN</p>

<p>Thank you. It was utterly beyond my power.
(<i>To the Agent</i>) Will you kindly take hold of
me and move me over <i>there</i>? (<i>The Agent propels
him away from the girl</i>) Thank you. At this
distance I can perhaps make my farewell in a
seemly and innocuous manner.</p>

<p class="charac">THE AGENT</p>

<p>Young man, you will not say farewell to that
young lady for ten days&mdash;and perhaps never!</p>

<p class="charac">THE YOUNG WOMAN</p>

<p>What!</p>

<p class="charac">THE AGENT</p>

<p>They have arranged it all.</p>

<p class="charac">THE YOUNG MAN</p>

<p><i>Who</i> has arranged <i>what</i>?</p>

<p class="charac">THE AGENT</p>

<p>Your aunt, Miss Brooke&mdash;and (<i>to the young
woman</i>) your uncle, Mr. Egerton&mdash;(<i>The young
people turn and stare at each other in amazement.</i>)</p>

<p class="charac">THE YOUNG MAN</p>

<p>Egerton! Are you Helen Egerton?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p class="charac">HELEN</p>

<p>And are you George Brooke?</p>

<p class="charac">THE AGENT</p>

<p>Your aunt and uncle have just discovered each
other up at the house, and they have arranged
for you all to take dinner together to-night, and
then go to a ten-day house-party at Mr. Egerton's
place on Long Island. (<i>Grimly</i>) The
reason of all this will be plain to you. They
want you two to get married.</p>

<p class="charac">GEORGE</p>

<p>Then we're done for! We'll have to get married
now whether we want to or not!</p>

<p class="charac">HELEN</p>

<p>What! Just to please <i>them</i>? I shan't do it!</p>

<p class="charac">GEORGE <span class="stagedir">(<i>gloomily</i>)</span></p>

<p>You don't know my Aunt Maria.</p>

<p class="charac">HELEN</p>

<p>And Tubby will try to bully me, I suppose.
But I won't do it&mdash;no matter what he says!</p>

<p class="charac">THE AGENT</p>

<p>Pardon what may seem an impertinence, Miss;
but is it really true that you don't want to marry
this young man?</p>

<p class="charac">HELEN <span class="stagedir">(<i>flaming</i>)</span></p>

<p>I suppose because you saw me in his arms&mdash;!
Oh, I want to, all right, but&mdash;</p>

<p class="charac">THE AGENT <span class="stagedir">(<i>mildly</i>)</span></p>

<p>Then what seems to be the trouble?</p>

<p class="charac">HELEN</p>

<p>I&mdash;oh, you explain to him, George. (<i>She goes
to the bench and, sits down.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p class="charac">GEORGE</p>

<p>Well, it's this way. As you may have deduced
from what you saw, we are madly in love with
each other&mdash;</p>

<p class="charac">HELEN</p>

<p>(<i>from the bench</i>) But I'm not madly in love
with municipal ownership. That's the chief
difficulty.</p>

<p class="charac">GEORGE</p>

<p>No, the chief difficulty is that I refuse to entertain
even a platonic affection for the tango.</p>

<p class="charac">HELEN <span class="stagedir">(<i>irritably</i>)</span></p>

<p>I told you the tango had gone out long ago!</p>

<p class="charac">GEORGE</p>

<p>Well, then, the maxixe.</p>

<p class="charac">HELEN</p>

<p>Stupid!</p>

<p class="charac">GEORGE</p>

<p>And there you have it! No doubt it seems
ridiculous to you.</p>

<p class="charac">THE AGENT <span class="stagedir">(<i>gravely</i>)</span></p>

<p>Not at all, my boy. I've known marriage to
go to smash on far less than that. When you
come to think of it, a taste for dancing and a
taste for municipal ownership stand at the two
ends of the earth away from each other. They
represent two different ways of taking life.
And if two people who live in the same house
can't agree on those two things, they'd disagree
on ten thousand things that came up every day.
And what's the use for two different kinds of
beings to try to live together? It doesn't work,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
no matter how much love there is between
them.</p>

<p class="charac">GEORGE</p>

<p>(<i>rushing up to him in surprise and gratification,
and shaking his hand warmly</i>) Then you're
our friend. You will help us not to get married!</p>

<p class="charac">THE AGENT</p>

<p>Your aunt is very set on it&mdash;and your uncle,
too, Miss!</p>

<p class="charac">HELEN</p>

<p>We must find some way to get out of it, or
they'll have us cooped up together in that
house before we know it. (<i>Rising and coming
over to the Agent</i>) Can't you think up some
scheme?</p>

<p class="charac">THE AGENT</p>

<p>Perhaps I can, and perhaps I can't. I'm a
bachelor myself, Miss, and that means that
I've thought up many a scheme to get out of
marriage myself.</p>

<p class="charac">HELEN <span class="stagedir">(<i>outraged</i>)</span></p>

<p>You old scoundrel!</p>

<p class="charac">THE AGENT</p>

<p>Oh, it's not so bad as you may think, Miss.
I've always gone through the marriage ceremony
to please them. But that's not what I
call marriage.</p>

<p class="charac">GEORGE</p>

<p>Then what do you call marriage?</p>

<p class="charac">HELEN</p>

<p>Yes, I'd like to know!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p class="charac">THE AGENT</p>

<p>Marriage, my young friends, is an iniquitous
arrangement devised by the Devil himself for
driving all the love out of the hearts of lovers.
They start out as much in love with each other
as you two are to-day, and they end by being
as sick of the sight of each other as you two will
be twenty years hence if I don't find a way of
saving you alive out of the Devil's own trap.
It's not lack of love that's the trouble with marriage&mdash;it's
marriage itself. And when I say
marriage, I don't mean promising to love,
honor, and obey, for richer, for poorer, in sickness
and in health till death do you part&mdash;that's
only human nature to wish and to attempt.
And it might be done if it weren't for
the iniquitous arrangement of marriage.</p>

<p class="charac">GEORGE <span class="stagedir">(<i>puzzled</i>)</span></p>

<p>But what <i>is</i> the iniquitous arrangement?</p>

<p class="charac">THE AGENT</p>

<p>Ah, that's the trouble! If I tell you, you won't
believe me. You'll go ahead and try it out,
and find out what all the unhappy ones have
found out before you. Listen to me, my children.
Did you ever go on a picnic? (<i>He looks
from one to the other&mdash;they stand astonished and
silent</i>) Of course you have. Everyone has.
There is an instinct in us which makes us go
back to the ways of our savage ancestors&mdash;to
gather about a fire in the forest, to cook meat
on a pointed stick, and eat it with our fingers.
But how many books would you write, young
man, if you had to go back to the camp-fire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
every day for your lunch? And how many new
dances would <i>you</i> invent if you lived eternally
in the picnic stage of civilization? No! the
picnic is incompatible with everyday living.
As incompatible as marriage.</p>

<p class="charac">GEORGE</p>

<p>But&mdash;</p>

<p class="charac">HELEN</p>

<p>But&mdash;</p>

<p class="charac">THE AGENT</p>

<p>Marriage is the nest-building instinct, turned
by the Devil himself into an institution to hold
the human soul in chains. The whole story of
marriage is told in the old riddle: "Why do
birds in their nests agree? Because if they
don't, they'll fall out." That's it. Marriage
is a nest so small that there is no room in it for
disagreement. Now it may be all right for birds
to agree, but human beings are not built that
way. They disagree, and home becomes a little
hell. Or else they do agree, at the expense of
the soul's freedom stifled in one or both.</p>

<p class="charac">HELEN</p>

<p>Yes, but tell me&mdash;</p>

<p class="charac">GEORGE</p>

<p>Ssh!</p>

<p class="charac">THE AGENT</p>

<p>Yet there <i>is</i> the nest-building instinct. You
feel it, both of you. If you don't now, you will
as soon as you are married. If you are fools,
you will try to live all your lives in a love-nest;
and you will imprison your souls within it, and
the Devil will laugh.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p class="charac">HELEN</p>

<p>(<i>to George</i>) I am beginning to be afraid of him.</p>

<p class="charac">GEORGE</p>

<p>So am I.</p>

<p class="charac">THE AGENT</p>

<p>If you are wise, you will build yourselves a
little nest secretly in the woods, away from
civilization, and you will run away together to
that nest whenever you are in the mood. A
nest so small that it will hold only two beings
and one thought&mdash;the thought of love. And
then you will come back refreshed to civilization,
where every soul is different from every
other soul&mdash;you will let each other alone, forget
each other, and do your own work in peace.
Do you understand?</p>

<p class="charac">HELEN</p>

<p>He means we should occupy separate sides of
the house, I think. Or else that we should live
apart and only see each other on week-ends.
I'm not sure which.</p>

<p class="charac">THE AGENT <span class="stagedir">(<i>passionately</i>)</span></p>

<p>I mean that you should not stifle love with
civilization, nor encumber civilization with love.
What have they to do with each other? You
think you want a fellow student of economics.
You are wrong. <i>You</i> think you want a dancing
partner. You are mistaken. You want a
revelation of the glory of the universe.</p>

<p class="charac">HELEN</p>

<p>(<i>to George, confidentially</i>) It's blithering nonsense,
of course. But it <i>was</i> something like
that&mdash;a while ago.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p class="charac">GEORGE <span class="stagedir">(<i>bewilderedly</i>)</span></p>

<p>Yes; when we knew it was our first kiss and
thought it was to be our last.</p>

<p class="charac">THE AGENT <span class="stagedir">(<i>fiercely</i>)</span></p>

<p>A kiss is always the first kiss and the last&mdash;or
it is nothing.</p>

<p class="charac">HELEN <span class="stagedir">(<i>conclusively</i>)</span></p>

<p>He's quite mad.</p>

<p class="charac">GEORGE</p>

<p>Absolutely.</p>

<p class="charac">THE AGENT</p>

<p>Mad? Of course I am mad. But&mdash;(<i>He turns
suddenly, and subsides as a man in a guard's
uniform enters.</i>)</p>

<p class="charac">THE GUARD</p>

<p>Ah, here you are! Thought you'd given us
the slip, did you? (<i>To the others</i>) Escaped
from the Asylum, he did, a week ago, and got a
job here. We've been huntin' him high and
low. Come along now!</p>

<p class="charac">GEORGE</p>

<p>(<i>recovering with difficulty the power of speech</i>)
What&mdash;what's the matter with him?</p>

<p class="charac">THE GUARD</p>

<p>Matter with him? He went crazy, he did,
readin' the works of Bernard Shaw. And if he
wasn't in the insane asylum he'd be in jail. He's
a bigamist, he is. He married fourteen women.
But none of 'em would go on the witness stand
against him. Said he was an ideal husband,
they did. Fourteen of 'em! But otherwise he's
perfectly harmless. Come now!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p class="charac">THE AGENT <span class="stagedir">(<i>pleasantly</i>)</span></p>

<p>Perfectly harmless! Yes, perfectly harmless!
(<i>He is led out.</i>)</p>

<p class="charac">HELEN</p>

<p>That explains it all!</p>

<p class="charac">GEORGE</p>

<p>Yes&mdash;and yet I feel there was something in
what he was saying.</p>

<p class="charac">HELEN</p>

<p>Well&mdash;are we going to get married or not?
We've got to decide that before we face my
uncle and your aunt.</p>

<p class="charac">GEORGE</p>

<p>Of course we'll get married. You have your
work and I mine, and&mdash;</p>

<p class="charac">HELEN</p>

<p>Well, if we do, then you can't have that sunny
south room for a study. I want it for the
nursery.</p>

<p class="charac">GEORGE</p>

<p>The nursery!</p>

<p class="charac">HELEN</p>

<p>Yes; babies, you know!</p>

<p class="charac">GEORGE</p>

<p>Good heavens!</p>

<h3>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p class="pg">Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p class="pg">Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3>Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification

<h3>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p class="pg">Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p class="pg">The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p class="pg">While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p class="pg">International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p class="pg">Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p class="pg">Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p class="pg">Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p class="pg">Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p class="pg">This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
